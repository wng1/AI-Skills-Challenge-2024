Finding sensitive data between all the data produced in an organization requires different search
and recognition patterns, which are called sensitive information types.

Can be identified through regular expression or a function. In addition, corroborative evidence 
such as keywords and checksums can be used to identify a sensitive information type. 

Confidence level and proximity are also used in the evaluation process. 

1)  Recognize the difference between built-in and custom sensitivity labels

2) Configure sensitive information types with exact data match-based classification

3) Implement document fingerprinting

4) Create custom keyword dictionaries
