Imagine you work for a large financial institution. One day, your organization experiences a significant security breach. The breach exposed sensitive customer data and caused a disruption in your services. 
As a security professional, you need to quickly assess the situation, identify the root cause of the breach, contain the threat, and take appropriate remediation actions. However, with the vast amount of security data and the complexity of your organization's infrastructure, it can be challenging to navigate through the information and make informed decisions. 
This is where Copilot comes in. It's a powerful tool that integrates with various sources to provide you with the guidance and insights you need to effectively respond to security incidents and protect your organization's assets.
